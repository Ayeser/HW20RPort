        <h3>My Story</h3>
  <p><em>Coding with Purpose</em></p>
  <p>I am a full stack developer with a background of 13 years in pastoral ministry (currently working as a hospice chaplain). I completed a bootcamp in Full Stack Development from the University of Arizona and have training in MongoDB, MySql, Express, React.js, Node, and responsive web design. I also have a Masters in Divinity and 4 units of Clinical Pastoral Education. All throughout my career I have found ways to use technology to engage people in the most important questions of life. I am an ideal candidate to bring both technical and relational skills to a faith-based software company.
